# learnRayLib

This is a basic charged particle simulator.

IF YOU WANT TO MESS AROUND YOURSELF:<br>
-I recomend using VSCode, but it isn't mandatory

1:-download the files, or git clone <br>
2:in the terminal (within the game directory), type "dotnet run" and enter <br>
3:if it gives you an error, try running "dotnet add package RayLib-cs" in the game directory <br>

Sorry that the code is so poorly organized, I only spent a day on it and gave little thought to its mutability.
